#     The vsim tool provides HDL simulation based on the compiled and optimized
#     design and it provides various post-simulation analysis capabilities. In
#     simulation mode it expects to be provided with the optimization output for
#     the root of the design, or it will automatically produce such an
#     optimization from the root of the design.
#

#     The vsim tool provides HDL simulation based on the compiled and optimized
#     design and it provides various post-simulation analysis capabilities. In
#     simulation mode it expects to be provided with the optimization output for
#     the root of the design, or it will automatically produce such an
#     optimization from the root of the design.

help sccom
# The sccom command is actually two commands in one: sccom interacts with a C/C++ compiler to compile SystemC source code into the work library, and sccom -link takes the compiled source code and links the design. Type 'sccom -help' for complete syntax.

sccom -help
# Questa Intel Starter FPGA Edition-64 sccom 2022.1 compiler 2022.01 Jan 29 2022
#     The sccom command is a SystemC compiler driver used to compile SystemC
#     source files. It uses the GNU C/C++ compiler to create object files in the
#     work library for SystemC sources and uses the EDG front-end to create a
#     debug database that is used by the simulator GUI to display the design
#     objects for debug purposes.
#     
#     After the compilation step is completed, the 'sccom -link' command should
#     be used to create a "systemc.so" shared library that will eventually be
#     loaded in by the simulator when a SystemC design top is elaborated.
#     
#     The compilation of multiple SystemC source files can be distributed across
#     multiple machines, or across multiple cores on a single machine using the
#     -j argument. Distributed sccom compilation compiles source files in
#     parallel on multiple cores of single or multiple machines, as specified by
#     the user. The result is faster compilation.
#     
#     You can run this command from within Questa SIM, from the operating system
#     command prompt, or during simulation.
#     
#     To enable source debugging of SystemC code, you must compile for debugging
#     by specifying the -g argument of the CPP compiler.
#     
#     Compiled libraries have the following dependencies.
#     
#     * Platform --- If you move between platforms, you need to run vdel
#     -allsystemc on the working library and then recompile your SystemC source.
#     
#     * Version --- If you install a new release, you need to re-compile your
#     library with the current version of sccom. For example, you cannot use a
#     library compiled with v6.5 in a simulation using v6.5a vsim. You would have
#     to run sccom in v6.5a to re-compile your library (sccom -version displays
#     the version number of the compiler).
#     
#     During the linking of the design (with sccom -link), the order in which you
#     specify archives (.a) and object files is very important. You must specify
#     any dependent .a or .o before the .a or .o on which it depends.
#     
#     The sccom command can recognize the file type as either C or C++ by the
#     filename extension and will use the appropriate compiler, as follows.
#     
#     * gcc compiler on source files with C source extensions .c, .i
#     
#     * g++ compiler on source files with C++ extensions .CPP, .cpp, .C, .c++,
#     .cc, .cp, .cxx, .ii
